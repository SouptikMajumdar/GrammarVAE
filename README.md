This repository contains an approach to implement Grammar Restricted VAE For encoding and decoding arithmetic equations.
@@ University of Stuttgart Deep Learning Lab


    + All the model classes are present in models.py
    + The training method for each model is present in train.py
    + Evaluation method for each model is present in eval.py
    + Visulization methods are present in visualize.py
    + Code is tightly integrasted with mlflow library which is used for experiment tracking and hyperparamter tuning.
    + List of hyperparamters are present in hyperparameters/params.yaml which can be modified as required.
